Title: A function for tailoring PCA to change detection
Version: 0.0.0.9001
Author: Martin Tveten
Maintainer: Martin Tveten <matveten@gmail.com>
Description: Functionality for tailoring the choice of which principal 
    components to keep when detection of changepoints in the mean vector 
    or covariance matrix is the aim. The choice of principal axes to 
    project data onto is based on a normal state covariance matrix and
    a customizable distribution over relevant change scenarios.
